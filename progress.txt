# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- `flowchart` lint includes `react-hooks/refs`; avoid `ref.current` reads during render-time initialization and use non-ref constants for initial state.

- Implemented `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md` to generate deterministic test plans from PRD markdown input, including required section ordering, scenario mapping, and ambiguity/assumption recording.
- Files changed: `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md`, `flowchart/src/App.tsx`, `AGENTS.md`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The QA skill implementation pattern in this repo is documentation-first (`SKILL.md`) with explicit input contract, step flow, output convention, and checklist sections.
  - `flowchart` lint can fail due to `react-hooks/refs` even when build/typecheck pass; keep render-time initialization independent from refs.
  - When adding new skills, place them in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and keep structure aligned with existing `skills/prd` and `skills/ralph`.
