# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- `flowchart` lint includes `react-hooks/refs`; avoid `ref.current` reads during render-time initialization and use non-ref constants for initial state.
- `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md` uses mutually exclusive generation modes; when using free-text objectives, enforce one of the six objective types and deterministic output naming `test-plan-objective-<objective-type>-<slug>.md`.
- `skills/qa-plan-json/SKILL.md` should keep strict schema/versioning (`qaPlanSchemaVersion: 1.0.0`) and emit fail-fast validation messages with source-line references using `E-<code> [line <n>] ...` format.

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md` to generate deterministic test plans from PRD markdown input, including required section ordering, scenario mapping, and ambiguity/assumption recording.
- Files changed: `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md`, `flowchart/src/App.tsx`, `AGENTS.md`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The QA skill implementation pattern in this repo is documentation-first (`SKILL.md`) with explicit input contract, step flow, output convention, and checklist sections.
  - `flowchart` lint can fail due to `react-hooks/refs` even when build/typecheck pass; keep render-time initialization independent from refs.
  - When adding new skills, place them in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and keep structure aligned with existing `skills/prd` and `skills/ralph`.

- Extended `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md` to accept free-text testing objectives in addition to PRD input, with explicit mode selection and objective-type handling.
- Added objective-specific strategy templates for acceptance, bug, test-gap, flaky, refactor-for-testability, and performance planning modes.
- Enforced predictable objective-mode output naming via `test-plan-objective-<objective-type>-<slug>.md`.
- Files changed: `skills/qa-plan-generator/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep `qa-plan-generator` deterministic across both inputs by making mode selection exclusive and explicit before scenario generation.
  - Objective-mode plans should still follow the same section order as PRD mode and append only objective-specific strategy details.
- Deterministic filenames for free-text inputs need both normalized objective type and a stable slug from objective text.

- Added new converter skill at `skills/qa-plan-json/SKILL.md` that mirrors `skills/ralph` converter pattern with explicit conversion rules, ordering discipline, and strict validation expectations.
- Documented a versioned executable schema (`qaPlanSchemaVersion: 1.0.0`) covering deterministic test IDs, steps, commands, pass/fail criteria, retry rules, evidence fields, and source-to-JSON mapping.
- Defined actionable validation error contract with source line references and fix guidance for malformed/missing sections, invalid IDs/enums, and incomplete automated test commands.
- Files changed: `skills/qa-plan-json/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `prd.json`, `progress.txt`.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - QA converter outputs should remain stable by preserving Scenario Matrix row order and deterministic `TC-###` IDs when constructing JSON `tests`.
  - Validation should fail fast with explicit source line references to make downstream debugging and executor ingestion deterministic.
  - Keep handoff explicit: successful converter output path feeds directly into the loop executor skill.
